            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The Bhopal gas tragedy was a horrific industrial accident that occurred on the night of December 2-3, 1984, in Bhopal, India. A faulty valve at a pesticide plant owned by Union Carbide Corporation released about 40 tons of toxic methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas into the air, exposing over half a million people to the deadly fumes. The gas leak caused severe respiratory problems, eye irritation, blindness, and death for thousands of people in the vicinity. Many more suffered from chronic health issues and birth defects for years after the disaster. The Bhopal gas tragedy is considered one of the worst industrial disasters in history and a grave violation of human rights and environmental justice.</p>

            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The Great Smog of London was a **disastrous** air pollution event that affected the city in December 1952. It was caused by a combination of **coal burning**, **cold weather**, and **windless conditions** that trapped a thick layer of smog over the city for five days. The smog reduced visibility, disrupted transportation, and penetrated indoor areas. It also had a **devastating** impact on public health, causing respiratory problems, lung diseases, and thousands of deaths. The Great Smog prompted the government to pass the **Clean Air Act** in 1956, which aimed to reduce air pollution and improve air quality.</p>

            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The **Kuwait oil fires** were a result of the **Iraqi military** setting ablaze hundreds of oil wells and other oil-filled areas in Kuwait in 1991, as part of a **scorched earth policy** to hinder the advance of the US-led coalition forces in the Gulf War. The fires started in January and February 1991, and lasted until November 1991, creating massive environmental and economic damage. The fires produced thick smoke plumes that reduced visibility, affected air quality, and altered the regional climate. The fires also consumed millions of barrels of oil per day, depriving Kuwait of its main source of income. The extinguishing of the fires required the efforts of international experts and specialized equipment.</p>

            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The Donora Smog was a severe air pollution event that occurred in Donora, Pennsylvania, in October 1948. It was caused by a combination of industrial emissions, coal burning, and weather conditions that trapped the smog over the town for four days. The smog killed 20 people, sickened 7,000, and harmed countless animals and plants. The Donora Smog is considered the worst air pollution disaster in U.S. history and a catalyst for environmental and public health reforms. It also raised awareness about the effects of pollution on human and environmental health.</p>
